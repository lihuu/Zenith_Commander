# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## General Execution Guidelines

### Before Making Changes

- Commit current modifications to ensure a clean state.
- Run any necessary pre-build checks or tests to validate the existing codebase.

### After Making Changes

- Automatically run the build process.
- Ensure the build succeeds; if it fails, revert changes or fix issues before proceeding.
- Commit the new changes with a descriptive message.

### Additional Notes

- Always prioritize code quality and follow project-specific conventions.
- If build failures occur, analyze logs and address root causes promptly.
